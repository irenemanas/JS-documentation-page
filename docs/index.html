              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
              Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
              environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
              elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
              purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
                server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on
                a server.

              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
              resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
              expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
              from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system
              based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
              prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
              provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
              executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
              methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
              have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
              conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
              also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
              (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
              sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <p class="article__paragraph">
              With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both local and

            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code><code>x = 42.</code></code> This always declares a global
              variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              With the keyword let. For example,<code>let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope
              local variable. See Variable scope below.

            <p class="article__paragraph">
              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to
              any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
              variable, because it is available only within that function.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
              block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code
              will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
              block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <div class="code-container"><code class="article__code">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code></div>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

              <code class="article__code">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you
              can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
              specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
              you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
              same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
              alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <div class="code-container"><code class="article__code">const PI = 3.14;</code></div>

              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
              initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
              omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:

                  <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                  <li>
                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same
                    as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                  </li>
                  <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                  <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                  <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                  <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>

              as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
              execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="code-container">
              <code class="article__code">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>

            <p class="article__paragraph">
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
              evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
              executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="code-container">
              <code class="article__code"

            </div>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To
              execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to
              always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <div class="code-container">

              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
              confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <div class="code-container"><code class="article__code">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code></div>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses
              around the assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <div class="code-container"><code class="article__code">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code></div>

              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement
              looks as follows:

            <p class="article__paragraph">
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is
              executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
              passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.

              values:
            </p>
            <ul class="section__list">
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function
              keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <ul class="section__list">
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
              <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="article__paragraph">For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <div class="code-container">
              <code class="article__code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            </div>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function,
              but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling
              function.
