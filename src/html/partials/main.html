      JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside
      a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
      provide programmatic control over them.

      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
      elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
      purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
        continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
        server.
